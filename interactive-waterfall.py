This way a system in thermal equilibrium would have zero radiative forcing. Where solar irradiance is the amount of sun’s energy received per unit area per second with units of Watts per meter squared. A positive radiative forcing means more energy is absorbed by the Earth than reflected back into space, which results in the Earth getting warmer and vice versa.
